# Briefly about the project
This is a console program that builds a graph based on the data transmitted by the user and distributes the ants along the paths so that everyone reaches from `A` to `B` in a minimum of steps.

> Also you can use web version for visualize your result. To do this, insert the map with result into the `text result` block and click on <kbd>Set Params</kbd>. Now your graph is represented graphically.
# How use program
> Program takes only 1 argument. 
It can be filename or flags.
#### Default:
- `"filename"` - your file path with graph data
#### Flags:
- `--file="filename"` - as default input. Just an explicit launch with a file
- `--http=":port"` - starts run server on your port. Using for visualization.

For run project:
```bash
go run ./cmd (filename | --http=:port | --file=filename)
```
### Example:
Run program:
```bash
$ go run ./cmd example.txt
#My comment
3
##start
start 2 2
r1 3 1
r2 3 3
r3 4 1
##end
end 5 2

start-r1
start-r2
r1-r3
r2-end
r3-end
L1-r2 L2-r1 
L1-end L2-r3 L3-r2 
L2-end L3-end 
```
Run visualization:
```bash
$ go run ./cmd --http=:8080
YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss Server started on http://localhost:8080
```

The program is provided with information about the graph (anthill) at the input:

- Number of `ants` (ants > 0)
- The name of the vertices and their coordinates. The `##start` and `##end` commands specify the starting and ending vertices of the path. (x > 0 & y > 0)
- Edges connecting vertices.
- Optional comments starting by `#` (program ignore them)
# Graphs in file
The map file looks like this
```txt
#My comment
3
##start
start 2 2
r1 3 1
r2 3 3
r3 4 1
##end
end 5 2

start-r1
start-r2
r1-r3
r2-end
r3-end
```
